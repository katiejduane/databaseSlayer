-- SQL 201----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
-- JOIN allows us to bring two tables together. JOIN makes table wider.
-- UNION makes tables taller.
SELECT * FROM payments 
	JOIN customers ON payments.customerNumber = customers.customerNumber
WHERE amount > 1000;

-- get payments about 1k, with employee sales rep name
SELECT payments.amount, customers.customerName, employees.firstName, employees.lastName FROM payments
	INNER JOIN customers ON customers.customerNumber = payments.customerNumber
	INNER JOIN employees ON customers.salesRepEmployeeNumber = employees.employeeNumber;
	
-- Select sales reps and their employees
SELECT * FROM employees
	INNER JOIN customers ON employees.employeeNumber = customers.salesRepEmployeeNumber;

-- create a table within the database
CREATE TABLE test (
	id int(11),
	name varchar(50),
	job varchar(50),
	salary int(6)
);

-- alter table to remove a particular column
ALTER TABLE test DROP COLUMN salary;

-- inserting rows is common! making databases less so; you won't insert them by hand, but you'll need to know how to write the query so nodeJS can
-- add rows as needed (eg: a user signing up for a service)
INSERT INTO test (id, name, job)
	VALUES
	(1, 'Rob', 'Teacher');

-- UPDATE a record
UPDATE test SET name = "Robert"
WHERE name = "Rob";

-- DELETE a record
DELETE FROM test WHERE id = 1;
